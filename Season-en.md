# The best time to see the striped eagles

**The best time to observe the striped eagles is in mid-winter, from December to February**. You can sometimes see them even in central Hokkaido, as they come down from the forest to human settlements in search of sap from roadside trees and other plants.

As winter begins to end, the striped eagles return to the forest again, so it is recommended to visit Hokkaido during the snow season.
Sightings are almost non-existent by early March, so plan accordingly so that you do not miss the best time to observe them.
